Zero covariance means that the two datasets/variables are completely independent, and the sign of the covariance can indicate whether the two change in the same direction (positive) or in different directions (negative). There is an in-built function called cov() in numpy that does the same calculation. I used it to check if my calculations are correct and the values are close to second decimal. \n",
